- Just someone looking to make my developer workflow more awesome, write pretty code and find the one programming language to rule to them all

## Fun Facts
- I use (n)vim for almost everything
- Even my vscode (which I rarely use btw) looks identical to neovim
- I am super interested in low-level programming: compilers, network protocols etc
- My favourite programming language are Rust and Gleam, buuut I would default to python if my life depends on it (i.e coding interviews ðŸ˜¸)
- You can reach out to me for anything really on twitter (or X) at  [x.com/rasibx](https://x.com/rasibx) or just `rasib` on discord
  - PS: also open to chat about projects, books, anime, PL, vim, terminal nerd stuff etc (reach out!)
